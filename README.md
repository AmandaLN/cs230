Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The client, The Gaming Room, has asked Creative Technology Solutions (CTS) to facilitate the development of the web-based version of their Android gaming app, Draw It or Lose It. The game must be able to run on multiple platforms. The application will get images for the game from a large library of stock drawings.
What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I believe I effectively communticated the requirments of the client and the design contraints.
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I found completing the design document to be helpful with code, becuase it gives you an outline of the work needed to be done. As well as keeping me organized on the task at hand.
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would revise the evaluation and dig into the system archiecture view further.
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I made sure the user's needs were met within the recommondations. It is important that the needs of clients be met or else you will lose buisness. 
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I would complete more research then I did for this project.
